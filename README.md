# Python-Challenge
In the first part of this challenge, I analysed bank data to determine how many months the data covered, the total earnings, the net change in earnings, the month with the greatest earnings increase and the associated amount earned, and the month with the greatest decrease and the associated amount lost.

In the second part of this challenge, I used election data to determine the total number of votes cast in the election, who the candidates were, how many votes each candidate received, what percentage of votes each candidate received, and the winner of the election.
